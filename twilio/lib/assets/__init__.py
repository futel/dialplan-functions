# Assets. This is a Python module because the tooling that lets us access this appears to
# manipulate the Python import path only. We want to have a more appropriate data file format
# like JSON. A more appropriate solution is probably to use some kind of packager that is
# quick to unbundle. A more appropriate solution is probably to use DigitalOcean Spaces, with
# all of the versioning hassles that implies. Or maybe convert everything to a DigitalOcean App.
