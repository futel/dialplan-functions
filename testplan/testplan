outgoing dialtone tests:
- notes
  - XXX many of these tests don't need to be done for each extension, just 1 dialplan, 1 asterisk
  - valid numbers are
    - domestic PSTN numbers (10 digit prefixed by 1, +1, 0111, or nothing)
    - international PSTN numbers (12 digit prefixed by 52 or 01152)
    - valid 3 digit numbers (911, 933, 211, ...XXX)
  - Client behavior we want to test is
    - client-provided dialtone (first client send is number)
    - our dialtone (first client send is #, client navigates to dialtone if not there)
  - dial 933 to test emergency calls, do not dial 911!
- 0 sends to operator from dialtone
- valid versions of 5035551212, 8005551212, 5555551212 send to operator
- 911 acts appropriately (destination or notify)
- other valid 3 digit calls call their destinations
- caller ID is appropriate
- # sends to default context
- call terminates correctly after timeout XXX

outgoing asterisk for each extension:
- notes
  - each extension gets tranfered to asterisk differently, either immediately, or when it hits a context not implemented by the dialplan
  - once asterisk is reached, test that first context and outgoing dialtone tests work
  - extension, has-emergency, caller-id
- bottles-and-cans-one no incoming_leet
- bottles-and-cans-two no incoming_leet
- cesar-chavez yes cesar-chavez
- demo no incoming_leet
- dome-basement no incoming_leet

- dome-garage no incoming_leet
- dome-office no incoming_leet
- ghost-mountain yes ghost-mountain
- r2d2 yes r2d2
- ry4an-test outging_ypsi no incoming_leet
- sjac no sjac
- test no test

outgoing operator tests:
- calling operator plays intro, then music while operators are called
- calling operator dials all operators
- answering operator call plays operator menu
- accepting operator call connects caller with operator if one or more callers are waiting
- accepting operator call plays message if no callers are waiting
- accepting operator call terminates all ringing operators if no other callers are waiting
- accepting operator call plays message for all operator menus if no other callers are waiting
- accepting operator has no effect on other calls if other callers are waiting
- denying operator call hangs up on operator
- denying operator call does not affect caller
- denying operator call does not affect ringing operators
- denying operator call does not affect other operators hearing menu
- caller gets operator voicemail if no operator accepts before timeout
- caller gets hangup after voicemail ends
- caller gets hangup after operator hangup
- operator gets hangup after caller hangup

dialplan ivr menus:

  - 0 at top menu chooses operator
  - 0 at non-top menu restarts menu
  - no action terminates correctly after XXX iterations
